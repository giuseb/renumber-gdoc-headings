# renumber-gdoc-headings
A Google Apps script to correctly (re)number headings in a Google Doc

The function renumberHeadings() adds to all heading paragraphs in the active document progressive numbering in the form of 1.2.3...

Heading numbers and the actual title are separated by a tab character.

Previously applied numberings are automatically overwritten every time the function is executed.
